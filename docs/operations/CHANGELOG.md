## [0.0.1] - 2026-01-06

### 🎯 What This Release Is

**MCP Context Browser v0.0.1** is an **architectural foundation** release. It establishes a SOLID, extensible codebase for semantic code search while implementing only basic functionality. This is explicitly **not** a feature-complete product, but rather a well-structured starting point for future development.

### ✅ Added

#### 🏗️ Core Architecture

-   **Modular Design**: Clean separation into `core`, `providers`, `registry`, `factory`, `services`, and `server` modules
-   **SOLID Principles**: Proper dependency injection, single responsibility, and interface segregation
-   **Thread Safety**: Comprehensive use of `Arc<RwLock<>>` for concurrent access patterns
-   **Error Handling**: Structured error types with detailed diagnostics (`CoreError`, `ProviderError`, etc.)

#### 📝 Type System

-   **Embedding Types**: Complete `Embedding` struct with vector data, model info, and dimensions
-   **Code Representation**: `CodeChunk` with file paths, line numbers, language detection, and metadata
-   **Search Results**: Structured search Result types with scoring and metadata
-   **Configuration Types**: Provider configs for embeddings (`EmbeddingConfig`) and vector stores (`VectorStoreConfig`)

#### 🔌 Provider Framework

-   **Provider Traits**: `EmbeddingProvider` and `VectorStoreProvider` traits for extensibility
-   **Mock Implementation**: `MockEmbeddingProvider` generating fixed 128-dimension vectors
-   **In-Memory Storage**: `InMemoryVectorStoreProvider` with cosine similarity search
-   **Registry System**: Thread-safe `ProviderRegistry` for provider management

#### 🏭 Factory Pattern

-   **Provider Factory**: `DefaultProviderFactory` for creating provider instances
-   **Service Provider**: `ServiceProvider` as dependency injection container
-   **Configuration Support**: Framework for provider-specific configuration

#### 🔧 Development Infrastructure

-   **Comprehensive Makefile**: Build, test, format, lint, version management, and release automation
-   **Professional Documentation**: Detailed README, API docs, and architecture guides
-   **MIT License**: Proper open source licensing with copyright notices
-   **Git Workflow**: Branching strategy and commit message conventions

#### 🤖 MCP Protocol (Basic)

-   **Stdio Transport**: Basic MCP server communication over standard I/O
-   **Tool Registration**: Framework for registering MCP tools (`index_codebase`, `search_code`)
-   **Message Handling**: JSON-RPC message parsing and response formatting
-   **Async Server Loop**: Tokio-based async server implementation

### ⚠️ Current Limitations

#### 🚫 Not Yet Functional

-   **Code Parsing**: Language detection works (14+ languages) but no actual AST parsing
-   **File Indexing**: Indexing service exists but returns 0 chunks (placeholder implementation)
-   **Semantic Search**: Search pipeline incomplete - doesn't connect embedding → storage → results
-   **MCP Tools**: Tools registered but return placeholder responses

#### 🏗️ Architecture Only

-   **Real Providers**: Only mock implementations (framework ready for OpenAI, Milvus, etc.)
-   **Configuration**: Config structs exist but no loading mechanism
-   **Persistence**: Only in-memory storage (no database integration)
-   **Testing**: Basic compilation but no comprehensive test suite

### 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

#### Code Structure & Architecture

```text
Lines of code: ~2,500
Modules: 12 (core, providers, registry, factory, services, server)

Structs: 25+ (Embedding, CodeChunk, SearchResult, ProviderRegistry, etc.)
Enums: 8 (Language, EmbeddingProviderConfig, VectorStoreConfig, etc.)
Functions: 50+ (async trait implementations, business logic, utilities)
```

#### Dependencies & Ecosystem Integration
