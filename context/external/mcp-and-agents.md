# External References: MCP and Agent Memory

Last updated: 2026-02-11 (America/Sao_Paulo)

## Scope

This file tracks external guidance and ecosystem references relevant
to context/memory management.

## Current Baseline

- Prioritize official MCP documentation for protocol-level behavior.
- Use mature OSS repositories as secondary references for file
  hierarchy and memory practices.
- Keep external notes short and actionable; store deep details in source links.

## To Refresh

- Official MCP docs updates affecting tool contracts.
- New long-memory patterns from prominent agent frameworks.
- Practical conventions for context compaction and freshness windows.

## Update Notes

- 2026-02-11: Created external reference anchor for future librarian sync.
