Last updated: 2026-02-11 (America/Sao_Paulo)

## Snapshot

- Current codebase emphasizes stable MCP tools, clean architecture,
  and validation-first workflows.
- Phase-series ADRs for workflow/context are present and should guide future implementation.
- Existing docs/context files remain authoritative historical context
  and are referenced for continuity.

## Active Signals

- Architecture validation (`mcb-validate`) is treated as a core quality gate.
- Beads is the canonical issue tracker workflow in this repository.
- Context system planning is concentrated in ADR-034..037 and ADR-041..046.
